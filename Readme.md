# Tic-Tac-Toe AI 🎮

A Python-based Tic-Tac-Toe game featuring Human vs AI, AI vs AI matches, and algorithm performance comparison. This project implements the Minimax algorithm and its optimized version, Alpha-Beta Pruning, to create intelligent AI players.

## Features ✨

- Play against Minimax AI or Alpha-Beta AI.
- Watch AI vs AI matches.
- Compare the performance of Minimax and Alpha-Beta algorithms.
- Memoized Minimax and Alpha-Beta implementations for optimization.

## How to Run 🏃‍♂️

1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. Save the code as `tictactoe.py`.
3. Open a terminal and run the following command:
   ```sh
   python tictactoe.py

Follow the on-screen menu to select a game mode.

AI Algorithms 🤖
Minimax: Explores all possible moves to determine the optimal one.
Alpha-Beta Pruning: Optimized Minimax algorithm that skips unnecessary branches, improving performance.
Example Gameplay 🎮

| 0 | 1 | 2 |
| 3 | 4 | 5 |
| 6 | 7 | 8 |

X's turn. Input move (0-8): 0
O makes a move to square 4

Performance Comparison 🚀
The Compare Algorithm Performance option measures the average execution time of Minimax and Alpha-Beta algorithms over multiple runs and displays the improvement percentage.
